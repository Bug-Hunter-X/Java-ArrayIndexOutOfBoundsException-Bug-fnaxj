This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates a common off-by-one error leading to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The buggy code attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate through an array using the `<` operator to ensure the loop terminates before accessing an invalid index. The solution also includes robust error handling for future improvements.
